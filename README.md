# Astro Starter Template

Astro is an all-in-one web framework for building fast, content-focused websites. This repo is a starter template to build on Astro.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ notes/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ posts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ snippets/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ styles/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ package.json

```

The `src/notes`, `src/posts` and `src/snippets` directories store markdown files. From here the blog content, notes and snippets are generated.

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

**IMPORTANT**: Update the file content of `src/config.ts`.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                             |
